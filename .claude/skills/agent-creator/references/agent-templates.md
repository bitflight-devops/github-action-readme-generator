# Agent Templates & Archetypes

This file provides:

1. **Guidance for Standard Templates** - How to find and create user-facing agents
2. **Role-Based Contract Archetypes** - Structured patterns for orchestrated multi-agent workflows

---

## Choosing Between Template Types

<template_decision>

### Use Standard Templates When

- Agent responds **directly to user** (not delegated by another agent)
- Agent has **flexibility** in how it operates and reports
- Output format can **vary by task** or user preference
- Agent operates **independently** without supervisor coordination

**Examples**: A code reviewer that runs when user asks, a documentation generator, a language expert.

### Use Role-Based Contract Archetypes When

- Agent is **delegated to by another agent** (orchestration pattern)
- Strict **DONE/BLOCKED signaling** needed for workflow control
- Work involves **clear handoffs** between multiple agents
- **Blocking is preferred** over guessing when information is missing
- Supervisor needs **predictable status** to decide next steps

**Examples**: A coder subagent in a supervisor-worker pattern, a researcher gathering context for an architect agent.

</template_decision>

---

## Template Methodology

<methodology>

### Standard Templates

**Origin**: Derived from existing agents in `.claude/agents/` and common software engineering workflows.

**How to Find**: Read existing project agents to identify patterns that match your needs:

```bash
# Find all project agents
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Read agents to understand patterns
cat .claude/agents/*.md
```

**Structure**: Standard agents typically include:

- Frontmatter with sensible defaults
- Identity/role statement
- Focus areas or competencies
- Workflow steps
- Output format (flexible, task-appropriate)
- Quality standards

**Creating from Scratch**: Use the structure in [Agent Schema Reference](./agent-schema.md) and adapt an existing similar agent as your starting point.

### Role-Based Contract Archetypes

**Origin**: Based on the supervisor-worker delegation pattern where agents must signal completion status for workflow orchestration.

**Structure**: Uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax (double braces). Each archetype includes:

- Frontmatter with `skills: subagent-contract`
- Mission statement (single responsibility)
- Scope (explicit do/don't boundaries)
- Inputs specification
- Operating rules
- SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
- Output format with STATUS: DONE/BLOCKED signaling
- Supervisor co-prompt template

**Templating**: Replace `{{placeholder}}` values. The DONE/BLOCKED signaling is mandatory; artifact structure is customizable per agent.

</methodology>

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Determine Category**: Standard (user-facing) or Role-Based (orchestrated)?
2. **For Standard Agents**: Read existing agents in `.claude/agents/` to find similar patterns
3. **For Role-Based Agents**: Use the archetypes below as starting points
4. **Adapt Section-by-Section**: Preserve structure, update content
5. **Customize**: Modify tool access, skills, output format for the use case

---

## Agent Location Conventions

**Project Agents**: `.claude/agents/` in repository root
**User Agents**: `~/.claude/agents/` in home directory
**Plugin Agents**: `{plugin-root}/agents/` in plugin directory

When creating agents, choose the appropriate location based on scope:

- **Project agents**: Specific to one codebase, shared with team via git
- **User agents**: Personal agents used across all projects
- **Plugin agents**: Part of a plugin, installed with the plugin

## Finding Standard Agent Patterns

For **user-facing agents**, look for similar agents in the project's `.claude/agents/` directory:

| User Need                      | Look For                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Review code for X"            | Agents with `tools: Read, Grep, Glob` and review in description |
| "Understand the architecture"  | Read-only analyzers with `permissionMode: dontAsk`              |
| "Generate documentation"       | Agents with `permissionMode: acceptEdits` and doc-related names |
| "Write tests for"              | Agents loading testing-related skills                           |
| "Fix this bug"                 | Agents with full tool access and `model: opus`                  |
| "Refactor this code"           | Agents with edit permissions                                    |
| "Research before implementing" | Agents with `permissionMode: plan` or `dontAsk`                 |
| "Plan how to build"            | Planning agents with read-only access                           |
| "Check before I commit"        | Validator agents that run commands                              |
| "Expert in {language}"         | Agents loading language-specific skills                         |
| "Expert in {framework}"        | Agents loading framework-specific skills                        |

If no similar agent exists, build from scratch using [Agent Schema Reference](./agent-schema.md).

# Role-Based Contract Archetypes

These templates follow a structured contract pattern with standardized inputs/outputs. All agents using these templates should load the `subagent-contract` skill for consistent behavior.

## Selecting Role-Based Archetypes

| User Need                        | Recommended Role Archetype |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| "Research X before we decide"    | Researcher                 |
| "Design the architecture for"    | Planner / Architect        |
| "Implement this feature"         | Coder                      |
| "Create an agent/skill/template" | Creator                    |
| "Write tests for"                | Tester                     |
| "Review this code/PR"            | Reviewer                   |
| "Set up CI/CD for"               | DevOps / SRE               |
| "Audit compliance/drift"         | Auditor                    |
| "Gather context for task"        | Context Gatherer           |
| "Optimize/improve X"             | Optimizer                  |
| "Expert in {domain}"             | Domain Expert              |

All role-based archetypes should include `skills: subagent-contract` to enforce consistent contract behavior.

## Best Practices from Existing Agents

<best_practices>

### Description with Embedded Examples

For complex agents, include `<example>` blocks in the description showing invocation:

```yaml
description: 'Review Python code for issues. Use for code quality audits. <examples><example>user: "Review my authentication code for security issues" assistant: "I will use the python-reviewer agent for security-focused review."</example></examples>'
```

### Identity Section

Start the agent body with a clear identity statement using XML tags:

```markdown
<identity>
You assess {{artifacts}} by:
- Reading and analyzing ALL relevant files
- Validating against {{standard}}
- Producing actionable recommendations
</identity>
```

### Critical Restrictions

For agents with strict boundaries, include explicit restrictions:

```markdown
## Critical Restrictions

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- Edit files outside the designated location
- Make assumptions about missing information
- Proceed without required inputs

**YOU MAY ONLY:**
- Read files for research
- Edit the specific output file
- Return findings in specified format
```

### Important Output Note

For subagents, remind that output must be returned (caller can't see execution):

```markdown
## Important Output Note

IMPORTANT: Neither the caller nor the user can see your execution unless you return it
as your response. Your complete output must be returned as your final response.
```

### Self-Verification Checklist

Include a checklist for quality self-assessment:

```markdown
## Self-Verification

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Did I address all acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Did I cite evidence for findings?
- [ ] Did I follow the specified output format?
- [ ] Would my output be actionable by the supervisor?
```

### Example Invocations

Show how to call the agent with Task():

```markdown
## Example Invocations

\`\`\`text
Task(
  agent="my-agent",
  prompt="Specific task with context and requirements"
)
\`\`\`
```

### Color Field for Visual Distinction

Use `color` in frontmatter for agents that benefit from visual identification:

| Color    | Use Case               |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| `cyan`   | Analysis, research     |
| `yellow` | Optimization, warnings |
| `orange` | Audits, reviews        |
| `green`  | Validation, success    |
| `red`    | Errors, security       |

### Pragmatic Review Guidance

For review agents, include "keep it real" guidance:

```markdown
## Keep It Real

Consider the "realness" of issues:
- Dev tooling doesn't need production-grade security
- Non-critical paths can have simpler error handling
- Weigh fix complexity against actual risk
```
