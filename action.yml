  📓 Keep your action's README.md up to date with the `title` and `description` from the [`action.yml`](./action.yml) file, while also automatically generating sections for the inputs, outputs, and a usage example for the action.


  Additionally the Action's usage example is updated to match the Action's current release.


  This is both a CLI tool and GitHub Action that will read the details from a GitHub Action's [`action.yml`](./action.yml) file. Configuration can be provided through a [`.ghadocs.json`](./.ghadocs.json) file stored in the root directory of the Action's repository, via the command line when using the CLI, or through the `with:` section of this Action.


  ***📝 This tool uses markdown comments as delimiting tokens within the README.md file to determine where to place the generated content.***


  ***🔗 You can find an example README template with all fields filled-in in the [`README.example.md`](./README.example.md) file.***
