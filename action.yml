name: ðŸ““ GitHub Action's Readme Generator
author: Jamie Nelson <jamie@bitflight.io>
description: >
  This is a CLI tool and GitHub Action that reads in the details from a
  GitHub Action's `action.yml` file and updates the `README.md` file
  with the `name`, `description`, `usage`, `inputs`, `outputs`, and
  examples of the action.
  Configuration can be provided via a `.ghadocs.json` file stored in the
  root directory of the Action's repository, via the command line when
  using the cli, or via the `with:` section of this Action.

  This tool uses markdown comments as delimiting tokens within the `README.md`
  file to determine where to place the generated content.

  [`README.example.md`](README.example.md) example with all fields filled in, and no other free-form content.
