The file [`index.ts`](./index.ts) defines a class called `LogTask` that is used for logging and displaying different steps and messages in a consistent format. The class has various methods for logging different types of messages such as `debug` , `start` , `info` , `warn` , `success` , `fail` , `error` , and `title` . These methods take a description as an argument and display the message with an appropriate emoji and formatting.

The `LogTask` class keeps track of whether a log message belongs to a group or not using the `ingroup` property. It also keeps track of the maximum width of the step string to ensure consistent indentation.

The class uses the `chalk` library to add colors to the log messages and the `node-emoji` library to add emojis. It also uses the `@actions/core` library for logging messages in GitHub Actions.

Overall, the `LogTask` class provides a convenient way to log and display messages with consistent formatting and styling.
